            <h2>Prime Numbers</h2>
            <p>Write a PHP script that prints all integer values from 1 to 100.
                Beside each number, print the numbers it is a multiple of (inside brackets and comma-separated). If
                only multiple of itself then print “[PRIME]”.</p>

            <h2>ASCII Array</h2>
            <p>Write a PHP script to generate a random array containing all the ASCII characters from comma (“,”) to
                pipe (“|”). Then randomly remove and discard an arbitrary element from this newly generated array.
                Write the code to efficiently determine the missing character.</p>

            <h2>TV Series</h2>
            <p>Populate a MySQL (InnoDB) database with data from at least 3 TV Series using the following structure:
                tv_series -> (id, title, channel, gender);
                tv_series_intervals -> (id_tv_series, week_day, show_time);
                * Provide the SQL scripts that create and populate the DB;
                Using OOP, write a code that tells when the next TV Series will air based on the current time-date or an
                inputted time-date, and that can be optionally filtered by TV Series title.</p>

            <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
            <p>Exads would like to A/B test some promotional designs to see which provides the best conversion rate.
                Write a snippet of PHP code that redirects end users to the different designs based on the data
                provided by this library: packagist.org/exads/ab-test-data
                The data will be structured as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    “promotion” => [
                        “id” => 1,
                        “name” => “main”,
                        “designs” => [
                            [ “designId” => 1, “designName” => “Design 1”, “splitPercent” => 50 ],
                            [ “designId” => 2, “designName” => “Design 2”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
                            [ “designId” => 3, “designName” => “Design 3”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
                        ]
                    ]
                </code>
                <p>The code needs to be object-oriented and scalable. The number of designs per promotion may vary.</p>
