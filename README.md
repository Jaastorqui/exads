# Jon Ander Astorqui's practice

I have used Slim frameworkm 4 as a template for this test.

## Steps to install the Application

I have run this project in Docker

### 1) run docker with `docker-compose up`

For only MAC, uncomment docker-compose.yml:28

### 2) Once docker is installed, the folder vender will be in the project, then we can run the sql.sql into the database
user: jon
pass: ander
database: exads
host: localhost
port: 3306

### 3) Open the url (http://localhost:8080) to check my task.

## TESTS

I have done some tests inside of /tests.

Don't hesitate to ask me anything about the project or if something does not working well.
